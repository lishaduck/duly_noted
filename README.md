Better reminders for busy people.

## Why?

In theory, we love the idea of digital reminders.
However, modern reminder apps manage to both be too minimalistic and yet lack a clear UI.
We aim to change this.
We're building the future of reminders and note-taking with an open, multi-platform app for reminding.

With a defintion regarding doing things at the [right time][right-time], it felt suiting.

### Why not…

- **Notion**: It's closed-source, not standards based, primarily for notes.
- **Obsidian**: It doesn't do reminders, closed-source, primarily for notes, paid sync.
- **Google Keep/Reminders**: It's closed-source, Google loves killing stuff off, and it isn't very streamlined. Admittingly, it is nicely integrated, but that can be forgone.
- **Other**: Too opinionated, too cluttered, not enough functionality, etc.
